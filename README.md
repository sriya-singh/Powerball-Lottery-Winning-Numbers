# About the Project

Through this project, 6 luckiest numbers in the Powerball Lottery Game were predicted using ARIMA model which were found out to be 18, 23, 34, 48, 58 and 13. In the end, the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) was calculated which came out to be 11.47, 11.54, 12.68, 11.49, 9.66 and 7.56 respectively. Using the graphs, it was found out that there was white noise in the data due to which the predictions that were made were close to the mean.
